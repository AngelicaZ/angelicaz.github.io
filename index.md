email: <czhan129@jhu.edu>

I am a second year M.S. student of [the M.S.E. program in Robotics](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/MSE/) in [the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR)](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu//). 



In my undergraduate time, I joined [Prof.Cunjun Ruan](http://www.ee.buaa.edu.cn/info/1129/17618.htm)'s lab in 2017, conducting research in the field of **vacuum electronic devices**. In 2018 summer, I joined [Prof.Chun Zhang](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/ime/5910/2015/20150315131055824979933/20150315131055824979933_.html)'s lab in [Institute of Microelectronics](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/imeen/5943/index.html), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html), working on **improved k-means clustering algorithms and robotics**. In 2019 summer, I visited [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) and collaborated with [Prof.Loh Ai Poh](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/idp/staff/lohaipoh/) on **physical modeling and simulation in robotics**. In 2020 summer, I joined [Momenta](https://www.momenta.cn/) as an R&D intern and focusing on **SLAM algorithm and HD Map**. In 2021 fall, I joined [CCVL lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/) lead by [Prof. Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/), working on **visual question answering (VQA) models**. In 2022 summer, I interned at [Bonn University](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/university/university) under the supervision of [Prof. Jürgen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/), working on **semantic scene completion for LiDAR point cloud**. The current project I am working on at CCVL is **scene graph generation** utilizing a unified multimodal Transformer framework.



My research interests include computer vision, widely on machine learning and multimodal deep learning. I firmly believe that huge contributions could be made with interdisciplinary among these fields to benefit the world.
