I am an incoming dergraduate student major in Robotics M.S.E. in [the Whiting School of Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). 



Before entering JHU, I joined Prof.[Cunjun Ruan](http://www.ee.buaa.edu.cn/info/1129/17618.htm)'s lab in 2017, conducting research in the field of **vacuum electronic devices**. In 2018 summer, I joined Prof.[Chun Zhang](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/ime/5910/2015/20150315131055824979933/20150315131055824979933_.html)'s lab in [Institute of Microelectronics](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/imeen/5943/index.html), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html), working in the field of **image-processing algorithms and robotics**. In 2019 summer, I visited [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/)  and collaborated with Prof.[Loh Ai Poh](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/idp/staff/lohaipoh/) in the field of **robotics**.



My research interests include robotics, widely on machine learning, computer vision and large scale data analytics. I firmly believe that huge contributions could be made in researching these fields.
