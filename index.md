I am a first year M.S. student of [the M.S.E. program in Robotics](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/MSE/) in [the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR)](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu//). 



In my undergraduate time, I joined Prof.[Cunjun Ruan](http://www.ee.buaa.edu.cn/info/1129/17618.htm)'s lab in 2017, conducting research in the field of **vacuum electronic devices**. In 2018 summer, I joined Prof.[Chun Zhang](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/ime/5910/2015/20150315131055824979933/20150315131055824979933_.html)'s lab in [Institute of Microelectronics](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/imeen/5943/index.html), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html), working on **improved k-means clustering algorithms and robotics**. In 2019 summer, I visited [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) and collaborated with Prof.[Loh Ai Poh](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/idp/staff/lohaipoh/) on **physical modeling and simulation in robotics**. In 2020 summer, I joined Momenta as an R&D intern and focusing on **SLAM algorithm and HD Map**. In 2021 fall, I joined [CCVL lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/), working on **visual question answering (VQA) models**. The current project I am working on is **scene graph generation**.



My research interests include robotics, widely on machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing. I firmly believe that huge contributions could be made with interdisciplinary among these fields.
